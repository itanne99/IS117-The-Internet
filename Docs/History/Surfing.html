			<p>Back in 1993, a group of computer students from the University of Illinois was fascinated by the invention of the web, which had just happened a couple of years earlier. During this decade, webpages were completely different from what we know today. These platforms were not interactive and consisted mainly of paragraphs or just information. But the development of the web had intrigued various computer science students at the university, one of them being Marc Andreessen. Andreessen soon started creating programs with the goal in mind that everyone could use websites.</p>
			<p>Jim Clark, a powerful and wealthy businessman recruited Andreessen once this young creator graduated from college. The duo had a plan of developing a computer company; Mosaic. Clark and Andreessen wanted their innovative company to spread as much as other giant tech companies, Microsoft being one of them. However, Bill Gates, co-founder, and CEO of Microsoft had trouble seeing the opportunity of developing web interactions like the ones Mosaic had in mind. He created his own Microsoft network and planned to hold full power over the use of the web. Gates had just started to grow a monopoly; almost all of the PCs were running on Microsoft networks, and he had no intent to make less money.</p>
			<p>Mosaic eventually became ‘Netscape’. But the goals of the company were still the same. However, as Netscape became more popular they soon realized that Microsoft was a harsh competitor. Gates too realized the importance of the web since he saw the popularity that Netscape was accumulating. Both companies regarded each other as competitors and implicitly started a war between each other.</p>
			<p>Netscape was growing exponentially, and Microsoft was starting to get concerned. Gates decided to make an offer so that the two companies could work together, but he also decided to offer to buy Netscape. Netscape saw this offer as an opportunity to put a demand for the illegal offer since this was a behavior against monopoly policies in the United States. But, on another suspicious end was Netscape, which had previously hired lawyers prepared to fight any illegal actions by Microsoft</p>
			<p>Netscape continued to grow rapidly and soon became the giant. Meanwhile, Microsoft created internet explorer as a means to destroy Netscape. They put out several updates of internet explorer and also made sure to copy and better any move that Netscape made. Engineers from both companies worked around the clock with one only motivator in mind: destroy each other.</p>
			<p>However, Microsoft made a smart move that would without a doubt win the support of millions of people; internet explorer became free to use. There was nothing Netscape could do to beat Microsoft at that point. Microsoft and its engineers celebrated as they crashed a van against Netscape’s headquarters and with that, officially declared themselves winners of the Browser Wars. Although it was a victory against Netscape, Microsoft soon faced another giant; the United States government, which had also started a war against Microsoft’s monopoly. And even though the government found proof of Gates stating that he wanted to destroy or buy Netscape, Microsoft came out victorious once again as the judge decided that punishing the company was not fitting to the crime.</p>
			<p>When you open your browser and look for a website or start to do some research for a topic the first thing people usually do is head over to Google, or more specifically https://www.google.com, but before 1994 you would have to remember the link to a site or you would have to go on a scavenger hunt and surf the web to find the site you were looking for though link redirects. That all changed once Stanford students, Jerry Yang and David Filo, developed the search engine some of us know today as Yahoo.</p>
			<p>Yahoo, funny enough, was developed while Yang and Filo’s professor went on a year-long sabbatical. While Yang and Filo were successfully developing their software they ran into an issue that many startups face, lack of funds. In Silicon Valley, start-ups are surrounded by an ocean of venture capitalists and Michael Moritz, a venture capitalist at Sequoia Capital, went to visit Yang and Filo’s Trailer at Stanford when he heard about their software. While the company grew in size, they still struggled with the need for developing funds, so Moritz offered the idea of having ads on their search engine. But Yang and Filo were afraid that if they posted ads on Yahoo people would stop using their website. Luckily posting ads did the exact opposite for the company and even started a boom in interest from venture capitalists for startups related to the internet.</p>
			<p>With the increase in interest comes an increase in rivals, and Yahoo’s success did just so. In 1996 a new search engine popped up into the market by the name of Excite and in a matter of months Excite caught up to Yahoo in their number of features. Which led to a game of digital tennis between the two companies, when one company released a feature on their site the opposite company would develop the same feature too and this kept going on for a while.</p>
			<p>With the two companies stuck in their endless game of tennis, another company was able to grow under their nose. We now all know this company as Alphabet Inc. or more well known, Google, unlike Yahoo and Excite Google offered a different way of searching for sites. They organized their pages based on the number of views a site got and so this led to better search results since people would find what they needed more easily. But Google also faced the same difficulties as Yahoo and was struggling with their financials, so it was offered for Excite to take hold of the company for 1 million dollars. However, Excite decided to turn down the offer. Google is now worth over 100 billion dollars.</p>
			<p>With the denial of Excite absorbing Google, the creators of the website had to find someone to help them get their feet off the ground, so they went to Andy Bechtolsheim. Google showed Bechtolsheim their product, and he really liked what he saw, so he wrote them a check for $100k on the spot to help them get off the ground. For the average person, $100k is a lot of money, but in the valley, $100k is chump change, so Brin and Page had to find another source of financial income to help keep their company afloat. This is when venture capitalists John Doerr, the wealthiest venture capitalist in the valley, came into the spotlight of Google's fame. A meeting was set up between Brin, Page, and Doerr. Instead of Brin and Page asking Doerr for money they told him, “We will bring you $10 billion dollars in revenue.” Doerr thought it was funny because of how naive the two were. He had a good feeling about them and ended up writing them a check for $12 Million dollars. It was a good thing he did because he got his promised cut of the $10 billion dollars.</p>
			<p>While Google was still developing their product they still had to figure out how to make a revenue by not relying solely on one individual, so they had to discuss the inevitable as their predecessors had to discuss banner ads. Google was against the idea of banner ads and wanted the concept to have nothing to do with their product, so they had to come up with an innovative way of advertising. They ended up developing a system where a company would pay Google to have their website come up to the top of someone's search result. It was later found out that Brin and Page stole this idea from a company run by Bill Gross. Google ended up having to go to court over the matter but was resolved with Google having to pay Gross for the idea.</p>
			<p>On August 19th, 2004 Google decided to make their shared public and their starting price was $85, which was unheard of, but ever since then, their shares have never gone down their starting price. The company is still growing today and has made many apps that a lot of us use today, like Google Docs, Sheet, Maps, Calendar, and they absorbed companies like YouTube, Picasso (which got turned into Google Photos), and Blogger (which got turned into Google Sites).</p>
			<p>We have encountered multiple amazing companies throughout the years. But on the internet, we have seen modern and innovative websites. One of these is Amazon by Jeff Bezos. Which started in a garage in 1995. Another one of the most successful websites was created by Pierre Omidyar in 1995 which we know now as eBay. Both Amazon and eBay were launched around the same time and were successful in a couple of months.</p>
			<p>It took only 4 years for 50 million people to use the internet, and as the number of users has increased, the network has become more and more useful and more popular. For sites like Amazon, as the web became more popular, numbers started to demonstrate that the site was, without a doubt, a good investment. Wall Street soon noticed the exponential growth of Amazon as investors noticed the potential of this ‘library’. Amazon’s users were enchanted by the website since Bezos lowered the prices whenever he had the opportunity in order to boost the popularity of the website.</p>
			<p>But how do we make business on the internet without the risk of confidential information being stolen? Three mathematicians, Martin Hellman, Whitfield Diffie, and Ralph Merkle, developed Public-key cryptography. This allows the sender to send confidential information and only allow the business to have the key for this information. Once this was set, investors were even more interested in Amazon and eBay. eBay opened stocks and they soared on the first day, making it become a multi-billion company in very little time. Amazon’s value also doubled within a few weeks even though the company was not doing so well financially.</p>
			<p>Investors and Americans were putting their money on multiple websites with stock shares, not only Amazon and eBay. Buying stocks became popular all over the world. TV ad campaigns were also a popular investment. Investment in e-commerce was thriving.</p>
			<p>However, there was a collapse in the stock market, historically known as black Friday, after much of the investments in e-commerce came to a low because of an unexpected performance of selling websites during the holidays. Fortunately, Amazon and eBay succeeded through the crash of the stock market because they understood the power of the customer. Both were businesses whose goal was to satisfy the customers instead of just wanting to make a profit.</p>
