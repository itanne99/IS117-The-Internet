			<p>Although we now know music apps like Spotify and Apple Music, a couple of decades ago you would have had to go looking for a physical recording of your favorite song. Fortunately, mp3 files were introduced. Mp3 files created a music revolution that used computers as a medium. These young men created downloadable media players that would allow people to play music whenever they wanted. The music industry, however, did not want to turn into this new technology for music. They did not want music to be distributed so freely around the world.</p>
			<p>Napster was built so people around the world would use this browser to download mp3 files that other people on the web had in their possession. Napster created an opportunity for the music downloaders to be engaged and share content that they owned. And without a doubt, within weeks of its creation, Napster soared.</p>
			<p>However, there was an issue with downloading free music: copyright. The Recording Industry Association of America was not happy that music was being distributed around without the music industry being able to make the expected profits. To handle this issue, the Recording Industry Association of America started with a lawsuit against Napster and other websites like Youtube that would have big implications for the illegal distribution of copyright music. The association had the support of many soaring artists at the time, like Dr.Dre, who was very angry to have his fans listen to his music for free. Metallica, another popular band at the time, was on top of the association to make sure no one had access to their music unless they paid for it.</p>
			<p>Napster was the first website that allowed its users to engage and share content with one another instead of just being spectators. Likewise, Myspace arose in 2003 which was first used to share mp3 files, but after about 2 years transformed into a social network and almost everyone had a myspace account. Then came Mark Zuckerberg with the development of Facebook. Facebook was a social network that started at Harvard University, it continued to spread throughout different colleges and then companies around the United States, and now people from all around the world have Facebook accounts.</p>
